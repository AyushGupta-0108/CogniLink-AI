## 🚀 Project Overview

CogniLink AI acts like a digital waiter in a multi-cuisine restaurant — it receives a complex order, splits it into smaller tickets, directs each to expert kitchens, and then assembles all dishes into a perfect final meal.

- **Why it matters:**  
  Many current AI tools operate with one model at a time, which limits quality and throughput. CogniLink AI’s intelligent routing allows multiple specialized AI engines to collaborate, unlocking better results and scalability.

- **Core features:**  
  - Smart request classifier that divides tasks (code, image, writing)  
  - Parallel processing in dedicated “kitchens” (APIs/services)  
  - Centralized variable storage for coordination and final assembly  
  - Extensible architecture to add more AI specialties or tasks

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

- **Webhook** receives and stores user requests.  
- **Router** intelligently classifies and splits requests into typed tickets.  
- Three parallel kitchens(for now) generate expert outputs (code snippets, images, emails, etc.).  
- Outputs are stored and then combined into a cohesive, multi-part final response.
